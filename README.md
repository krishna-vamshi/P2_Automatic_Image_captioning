# Description - Solution 

This repository consists of the solution for the project: Automaic Image Captioning from the udacity Computer Vision Nanodegree. The solutions are uploaded as the HTML files of notebook 2_training and notebook 3_inference and the models_solution python file. 

Please restrain yourself from accessing it, if you are currently taking the course. The master code is not altered in any way.

Due to the high amount of time that requires to train the model, only 3 epochs are used for training and loss of 1.96 and perplexity of 6.7 is considered satisfactory

# CVND---Image-Captioning-Project

# Instructions  
1. Clone this repo: https://github.com/cocodataset/cocoapi  
```
git clone https://github.com/cocodataset/cocoapi.git  
```

2. Setup the coco API (also described in the readme [here](https://github.com/cocodataset/cocoapi)) 
```
cd cocoapi/PythonAPI  
make  
cd ..
```

3. Download some specific data from here: http://cocodataset.org/#download (described below)

* Under **Annotations**, download:
  * **2014 Train/Val annotations [241MB]** (extract captions_train2014.json and captions_val2014.json, and place at locations cocoapi/annotations/captions_train2014.json and cocoapi/annotations/captions_val2014.json, respectively)  
  * **2014 Testing Image info [1MB]** (extract image_info_test2014.json and place at location cocoapi/annotations/image_info_test2014.json)

* Under **Images**, download:
  * **2014 Train images [83K/13GB]** (extract the train2014 folder and place at location cocoapi/images/train2014/)
  * **2014 Val images [41K/6GB]** (extract the val2014 folder and place at location cocoapi/images/val2014/)
  * **2014 Test images [41K/6GB]** (extract the test2014 folder and place at location cocoapi/images/test2014/)

4. The project is structured as a series of Jupyter notebooks that are designed to be completed in sequential order (`0_Dataset.ipynb, 1_Preliminaries.ipynb, 2_Training.ipynb, 3_Inference.ipynb`).
